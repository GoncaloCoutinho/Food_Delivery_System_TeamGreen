# Food Delivery System from Team Green

In this project we are building a food delivery system. Our objective is to take specific use cases and develop the interactions between entities and databases.

We hope to use several different NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, Redis and Neo4j.

## Use cases
Use cases include assigning the optimal driver to a particular order, storing gps coordinates in a reliable and efficient manner and dealing with customer reviews of both the drivers and restaurants.

We will be using Python as the programming language to interact with the databases.
